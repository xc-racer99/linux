* Bosch BMA150 Accelerometer Sensor

Also works for the SMB380 and BMA023 accelerometers

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "bosch,bma150"
- reg : The I2C address of the sensor

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent : should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
- interrupts : Interrupt mapping for IRQ.  If not present device will be polled
- any-motion-int : bool for if the any motion interrupt should be enabled
- hg-int : bool for if the high-G interrupt should be enabled
- lg-int : bool for if the low-G interrupt should be enabled
- any-motion-cfg : array of integers for any motion duration and threshold
- hg-cfg : array of integers for high-G hysterisis, duration, and threshold
- lg-cfg : array of integers for low-G hysterisis, duration, and threshold
- range : configuration of range, one of BMA150_RANGE_* as defined in [1]
- bandwidth : refresh rate of device, one of BMA150_BW_* as defined in [1]

Example:

bma150@38 {
	compatible = "bosch,bma150";
	reg = <0x38>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gph0>;
	interrupts = <1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	any-motion-int;
	hg-int;
	lg-int;
	any-motion-cfg = <0 0>;
	hg-cfg = <0 150 160>;
	lg-cfg = <0 150 20>;
	range = <BMA150_RANGE_2G>;
	bandwidth = <BMA150_BW_50HZ>;
};
