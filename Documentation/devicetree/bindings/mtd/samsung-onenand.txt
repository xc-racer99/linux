Device tree bindings for Samsung SoC OneNAND controller

Required properties:
 - compatible : value should be either of the following.
   (a) "samsung,s3c6400-onenand" - for onenand controller compatible with
       S3C6400 SoC,
   (b) "samsung,s3c6410-onenand" - for onenand controller compatible with
       S3C6410 SoC,
   (c) "samsung,s5pc100-onenand" - for onenand controller compatible with
       S5PC100 SoC,
   (d) "samsung,s5pv210-onenand" - for onenand controller compatible with
       S5PC110/S5PV210 SoCs.

 - reg : two memory mapped register regions:
   - first entry: control registers.
   - second and next entries: memory windows of particular OneNAND chips;
     for variants a), b) and c) only one is allowed, in case of d) up to
     two chips can be supported.

 - interrupt-parent : phandle of interrupt controller to which the OneNAND
   controller is wired,
 - interrupts : specifier of interrupt signal to which the OneNAND controller
   is wired; should contain just one entry.
 - clock-names : should contain two entries:
   - "bus" - bus clock of the controller,
   - "onenand" - clock supplied to OneNAND memory.
 - clock: should contain list of phandles and specifiers for all clocks listed
   in clock-names property.
 - #address-cells : must be 1,
 - #size-cells : must be 1.

Example for an s5pv210 board:

	onenand@b0600000 {
		compatible = "samsung,s5pv210-onenand";
		reg = <0xb0600000 0x2000>, <0xb0000000 0x20000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
		interrupts = <31>;
		clock-names = "bus", "onenand";
		clocks = <&clocks NANDXL>, <&clocks DOUT_FLASH>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
	};
