Device tree bindings for Samsung SoC OneNAND controller

Required properties:
 - compatible : value should be either of the following.
   (a) "samsung,s3c6400-onenand" - for onenand controller compatible with
       S3C6400 SoC,
   (b) "samsung,s3c6410-onenand" - for onenand controller compatible with
       S3C6410 SoC,
   (c) "samsung,s5pv210-onenand" - for onenand controller compatible with
       S5PC110/S5PV210 SoCs.

 - reg : memory mapped register region for the controller
 - interrupts : specifier of interrupt signal to which the OneNAND controller
   is wired; should contain just one entry.
 - clock-names : should contain two entries:
   - "bus" - bus clock of the controller,
   - "onenand" - clock supplied to OneNAND memory via the controller.
 - clock: should contain list of phandles and specifiers for all clocks listed
   in clock-names property.
 - #address-cells : should be 1
 - #size-cells : should be 1
 - ranges : must be present

Optional children nodes:
Individual OneNAND chips are children of the OneNAND controller node. Currently
only one OneNAND chip is supported.

Required children node properties:
 - reg : memory mapped register region for the chip.
 - #address-cells : should be 1
 - #size-cells : should be 1

Each child device node may optionally contain a 'partitions' sub-node,
which further contains sub-nodes describing the flash partition mapping.
See partition.txt for more detail.

Example for an s5pv210 board:

	onenand-controller@b0600000 {
		compatible = "samsung,s5pv210-onenand";
		reg = <0xb0600000 0x2000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
		interrupts = <31>;
		clock-names = "bus", "onenand";
		clocks = <&clocks NANDXL>, <&clocks DOUT_FLASH>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		onenand@b0000000 {
			reg = <0xb0000000 0x20000>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;
		};
	};
