* Sharp GP2AP002A00F I2C Proximity/ALS sensor

The proximity detector sensor requires power supply
for its built-in led. It is also defined by this binding.

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "sharp,gp2ap002a00f"
  - reg : the I2C slave address of the light sensor
  - vled-supply : VLED power supply, as covered in ../regulator/regulator.txt
  - vout-gpios : gpio connected to the vout pin (checked for the proximity status)
  - io-channels : phandle to the ADC connected to the light sensor output
  - io-channel-names : must be "light"

Optional properties:

  - wakeup-source : if the chip can be used to wakeup the system

Example:

gp2a@44 {
	compatible = "sharp,gp2ap002a00f";
	reg = <0x44>;
	vout-gpios = <&gph0 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	vled-supply = <&gp2a_vled>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gph0>;
	interrupts = <2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH>;
	io-channels = <&adc 9>;
	io-channel-names = "light";

	wakeup-source;
};
